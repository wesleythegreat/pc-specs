Splash,Water and Dust Resistant
IP68Disclaimer: 
*The device has been tested and certified to be resistant to splash, water, and dust in the presence of specific laboratory conditions with the classification IP68 ingress protection based on IEC 60529:1989+A1:1999+A2:2013.
Please be noted that the test conditions of water resistance include: submersion in static freshwater up to a depth of 1.5 meters, up to 30 minutes, with a temperature delta between the water and product being 5K or less. Such water resistance features only pertain to specific conditions tested in a laboratory environment, which do not correspond to the normal conditions of use by consumers. Therefore, ingress protection is not assured if the product is subjected to environments beyond the test conditions. 
We recommend that you do not test it by yourself. Not advised for beach or pool use. Ingress protection might deteriorate from daily wear and tear, physical damage and/or disassembly needed in case of repair. 
Avoid charging the product, operating the physical buttons, or removing the SIM tray when product is exposed to moisture. 
Please carefully refer to user's manual for other safety instructions. 
The warranty will not cover the liquid damage caused in the environments beyond the IP68 test condition.
